Reference in C++

- Reference is a nickname given to a variavle or alias given to a variable.

int a = 10; // Common var
int *p; // Pointer
int &r = a; // Reference. Must be initialized.

- Motivation; This is useful in parameter passing. For writing small functions. We use reference instead of pointers.
