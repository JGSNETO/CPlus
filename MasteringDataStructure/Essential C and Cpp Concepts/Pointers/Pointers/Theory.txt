Pointes:

1. Why pointers
- Pointer is an address variables that is meant for storing address of data, not the data itself.
- Used for indirect access of data. 
- Pointers are used to access resources outside the program.

2. Main memory areas

2.1: Heap memory
2.2: Stack
2.3: Code 

3. Use of pointers:
- The program can directly access code section and stack memory. Heap is external to the program. To access pointers(On stack) are needed. 
- Pointers are used to access: Heap memory, resource and parameters passing. 
- malloc(): Get space on heap memory. e.g: p = (int *)malloc(5*sizeof(int));
