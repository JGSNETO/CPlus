# CPlus
# C++ for C programmers

- Object orientation is not about flow of control but you should be comfortable with recursion
- Type safety is usually a property of a good OO language
- Garbage collection can be built-in to an OO language or provided for user-defined object

### C++ improvements and advantages
- Different libraries most old C libraries still avaiable 
- Inline replace code macros
- Comment //
- iostream cin>> type safe
- Declaration can be intermixed after executable 
- Use of new (Replace malloc). Memory allocated in heap. 

### C++ is better than C

- More type safe
- More libraries
- Less reliance on preprocessors
- OOV vs imperative 

### New features

- Inline: Key word that modifies the function 
- Const
- static_cast<type>: safe cast
- namespaces
- iostream
- Declarations anywhere including 
- for-statement initialization 
- What is the difference between long and long long and int ? C++ allows for longer integer types starting with a shortest type short
### Swap function

- In C call by reference simulated with pointers.
- C++ has call by reference argument passing.

### Generics 

- Programming using templates
