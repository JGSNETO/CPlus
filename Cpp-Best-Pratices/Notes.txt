#New C++ Features

CPP11: Added lambdas, auto type destruction, list initialization, smart pointers, and move
semantics
CPP14: Gave us return type deduction, binary literals and generic lambdas expressions
CPP17: Structured binding, nested namespaces, inline variables, and contesxpr lambdas

#File name convetion

C++ files shoudl be named .CPP11
The iso C++ Committe prefers *.h
The boost library *.hpp

# Insert note here

#Size_t and auto

- Size_t is a basic usigned integer, size depends on system
- Size_t can improve your code portability and eficiency 
- For indexing containers, you should use size_type, also know as size_t

# The filesystem library

- Based on the boost library filesystem


# Managing objects 

#Which pointer when

- Modern c++ has three types of smart pointers

1. std::shared_ptr
2. std::unique_ptr
3. std::weak_ptr

#The rules of zero, Three, and five

-There are five class special functions 
1. Copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, move assignment operator, and
the destructor

The rule of five: If you create any of them, you should create them all. 

#Const is you friend 
- Const hepls your profile
- Const make your intentions clear 
- Less bugs and cleaner code
- Possible performance boost

#Resource acquisition is initialization
-RAII is about writing safer c++ code
-The destructor of stack objects are always called
-Stack objects are trashed in reverse order of their creation 
-So, any critical resources, should be created on the stack and they should be 
written to destroy themselfes properly
