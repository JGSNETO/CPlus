#Class x Structure

-In structure the data members default to public and class they default to private. 

#Getters x Setters:
-Setters: Set value of data members
-Getters: Get value of data members

#namespace
Managing naming colisions

#Operators overload
-It is not unique to c++. 
-Two ways:
1. With members functions as part of a class definition. 
2. With non-members functions. 
Structure:

nameOfTheClass operator operator(itself) the arguments
Rational operator = (const Rational &);

#Allocate memory
-New and delete are used to create and delete objects from memory. 

#Lambda functions 
-Lambda functions or expressions : Is an anonymous function with the ability
to refer to identifiers outside of its own scope. 
-Good when you dont need to re-use the code. 

#Compiler structure:
1. Preprocessor 
2. Compiler
3. Optimizer 
4. Linker 

#Macros:
#define ONE 1
constexpr int ONE = 1 

#Conditional processing 

#ifdenf CONDITIONAL_H_
#define CONDITIONAL_H_

#define TWO 2

#endif /* CONDITIONAL_H_ */
